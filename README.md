## Project Overview


1️⃣ [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Ff6i9yiF/best-places-to-live)

1️⃣ [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Best-Places-to-Live-57d6b61b6248443484edaf4d8e0e9092)

The Best Places to Live website and app is a single resource to allow users to weigh all their factors of moving to a new city at once.
It creates comparisons between cities based on a user's factors to help user's decision. The goal is for it to be fun and engaging for the user while minimizing the amount of time spent researching cities. 

The Data Science portions of this project can be lumped into three stages:
1. A city sorting model based upon user input factors
2. Data Visualization for each city with compare-city functionality.
3. Bonus features -- cholopleth & heat maps; a tender-style swipe features for finding that perfect city match.

### Tech Stack

- Python
- Heroku 

### 2️⃣ Predictions

The model of our flask API takes in a JSON as a POST request in the format: 

```Sample input:

{
"input1": ["population", "avg_commute_time"]
}
```

The input comes from users at the Front-End. They select any number of the displayed factors as important in deciding a new home city. The DS flask API then returns another JSON with 20 cities in format:

```{
    "name": "New York City, NY",
    "photoMobile": <url>,
    "photoWeb": <url>,
    "population": 8175133.0,
    "geohash": 9whpt4gjbqfngtthkk9f
  },
```

These 20 cities are ranked in order of best fit based upon user selected factors. 

The city ranking function within our model works with pandas operations on a small csv found in the home directory of the flask API. The data-frame itself is composed of the following features: 133 possible city ranking factors; names of cities; location data; photo urls. The numerical data for the 133 factors have been transformed using `df.rank()` on a scale of 0 to 1. This flattens the distribution of each numeric feature such that each factor when compared to others are on the same scale.
